These are just some quick notes on ideas I ran across browsing the web:

1. In latex, use the `\declare`s and such at the beginning to encapsulate 
ideas, rather than to save typing. Use editor macros for typing, if
you can.

2. Start each new sentence on a new line. It makes git control nicer,
and also makes the text a lot more readable.

3. Apparently people think eqnarray should be avoided. I liked it, but
I guess you can make align look good (my experience was that align looked
horrible because it didn't auto-shift the = horizontally, but the 'avoid
eqnarray' advice seems fairly standard.

Makefiles are highly recommended to avoid the two-cycle-plus-bibtex
type annoyance. Here's one possible source

Keep in mind other tools like Sweave (for R) and Lyx. There may be a python
version of Sweave in the works eventually.
