minbufexpl seems handy, but
  (a) I'm not sure it's worth the screen space it uses up, and
  (b) I need to read the documentation before it does me any good.

taglist is probably good, but I'm going to wait and make sure it isn't overriding
the P paste command. And again, I need to read the manual anyway (I think what it
does is give me a source code browser of some sort, and I might be able to do just
as well with the (vim/exuberant ctags) enhancement of the (vi/ctags) toolbox.
   So I'll probably wait till I've had time to finish skimming the vim for programmers
part of LTVVE first.
