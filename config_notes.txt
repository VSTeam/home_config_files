.bashrc does several important things (it may do others):
  (1) It sets my prompt. This is the PS1 business. Fernando considers
      the part about showing current branch to be uber-important.
  (2) It resets the up and down arrows to not just look thru old commands
      but to also consider what has been typed so far, and sets up git tab
      completion
  (3) It gives me colored ls as a default
  (4) It creates aliases ... thus far gi, da, de. The gi alias also
      required including someone's completion function wrapping code.
.local/share/applications/gvim-rc.desktop
   This, along with some right-clicking and 'open with' in the GUI, is
   needed to make clicking files in nautilus open them in an existing
   gvim session.
   It creates a new 'program', gvim (--remote-silent), that should be
   available in the applications list when you do that right-clicking
   business.
.gitconfig 
   Mostly not that important I think. Much of it I don't understand.
   Probably the biggest thing it does is give all those aliases for commands
   that Fernando thinks are useful. Of course, I need to get used to the aliases
   or they won't do me any good.
.gitignore
   This is obvious. The only thing that is easy to forget is that this does nothing
   unless it is called in .gitconfig ... if your .gitignore isn't working then you
   should make sure there is an excludesfile variable pointing to it in the [core]
   block of .gitconfig.
.bash_git_completion
   It contains stuff called by .bashrc to do git tab-completion.
.bash_utils
   Does a few things for .bashrc... the most obvious is that it defines a bunch
   of colors. It also has quite a lot of functions, but I don't know which functions
   are useful and which aren't.
.vimrc
   This does two sets of things: first, it does obvious stuff like setting tab
   rules and making column numbers show. Then, it calls programs from .vim.
   I don't yet really understand the structure of vim programs, so I can't explain
   much past that at this time.


DIRECTORIES
.config/ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py
   IPython stuff. I still need to find an example in order to set my ipython up.
   In reality, I am pretty happy with the presets. The only things I want to change
   are to auto-import some packages.
.vim
   This is where various vim programs go. I don't really understand how this stuff
   works, but my experience thus far is that vim programs generally just do what
   they are supposed to do without too much hassel (I had the opposite experience
   in emacs).
