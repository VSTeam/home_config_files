Config files and folders.

The way I did this was by putting ~ under version control (originally
I wanted to have a repo sitting in ~, but that requires either constantly
copying changes or using links, and git doesn't handle links well.

As a result, I had to use .gitignore as the ignore for this repo only,
and so my global gitignore file had to be renamed .gitignore_global,
which is fine because you specify the file in .gitconfig.

Whenever you want to add a file to the repo, you need to add a line
to .gitignore. Otherwise, you just have to go git commit -a
and git push origin master after any config alterations.

Notes regarding how config works are in config_notes, although I don't
really maintain that file so there may be incorrect things from
misunderstandings I had in the past.
