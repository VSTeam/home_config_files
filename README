Config files and folders.

The way I did this was by putting ~ under version control (originally
I wanted to have a repo sitting in ~, but that requires either constantly
copying changes or using links, and git doesn't handle links well.

As a result, I had to use .gitignore as the ignore for this repo only,
and so my global gitignore file had to be renamed .gitignore_global,
which is fine because you specify the file in .gitconfig.

TODO:
A better solution, and something I should try to get to eventually,
is to make this a repo sitting inside of ~, and to have scripts to
(a) copy all the files out of the repo into ~, and (b) copy all
the files from ~ into the repo, probably going file by file and
letting the user decide which changes to make.

Whenever you want to add a file to the repo, you need to add a line
to .gitignore. Otherwise, you just have to go git commit -a
and git push origin master after any config alterations.

Notes regarding how config works are in config_notes, although I don't
really maintain that file so there may be incorrect things from
misunderstandings I had in the past.

To get a solarized terminal set up, go to gnome-terminal-colors-solarized
and run ./install. The shell will ask you what profile you want to apply
changes to, as well as what profile to set.
    Note: as far as I know, the solarized terminal colors are the only
          linux-dependent things here. Everything else should work on
          Mac or any Unix version... I'm not sure about Windows, and
          if the .bashrc isn't working it might be because you have
          a .bash-profile or some such business.
